Electric spinning wheel motor controller
----------------------------------------
There is already one out there based on Arduino. But I want to create one based on ATtiny13 written in assemly. Why? We only need one input for potmeter and one output for driving the motor. Thus we should not need anything more complicated than a ATtiny13 which has 6 IO pins. The program is also fairly small so it would be a fun excersise to write it in assembly rather than C. It could also serve as a good example for others who want to experiment with assembly programming.
